# FUN PROJECT
# Radar System in Space Engineers
This project demonstrates the operation of a radar system using the Space Engineers physics engine. The radar system is designed to manage multiple radar installations, where each radar locks onto a specific target and tracks its movement by continuously updating its current coordinates.

# Features - Complited
Multiple Radar Management: The system can handle multiple radar installations simultaneously.

Target Locking: Each radar can lock onto a specific target.

Real-Time Tracking: Radars continuously receive and update the coordinates of their respective targets.

# Overview
The radar system in this project is implemented using the Space Engineers physics engine. Each radar installation is capable of locking onto a target, tracking its movements in real-time, and updating its coordinates. This setup is useful for applications where continuous monitoring and tracking of multiple targets are required.
